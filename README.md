# Godot State Machine

Simple code only state machine that's is originally based off [GDQuest's implementation](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/design-patterns/finite-state-machine/).

## Features (or problems)
- States are nodes
- Nested states, but only 1 level (parent and child)
- Support for deferred state transitions
- Bulk of the logic is in one file (under 200 lines)
